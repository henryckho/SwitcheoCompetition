# SwitcheoCompetition

I created a Trello Board for what the tasks I have in mind: https://trello.com/b/426RUs1c/switcheo-competition

## Background
Switcheo generally has scheduled maintenance and when they have scheduled maintenance people can't access their contract wallet.

This project is for people to access their contract wallet and to withdraw the balances from the contract into their wallet.

This project uses [Angular IO](https://angular.io/) and uses the [Switcheo API](https://docs.switcheo.network/)

## Setup
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm start` this will run `ng serve --port 8080 --open`
